# Chatbot-with-Machine-Learning-and-Python
Since I will be developing a Chatbot with Python using Machine Learning, I need some data to train our model. But I am not going to collect or download a large dataset since this is just a chatbot. I can just create our own dataset to train the model.
To create this dataset to create a chatbot with Python, I need to understand what intents we are going to train. An “intention” is the user’s intention to interact with a chatbot or the intention behind every message the chatbot receives from a particular user.

Now I need to define a few simple intents and a group of messages that match those intents and also map some responses based on each intent category. I’ll create a JSON file named “intents.json” including this data as follows.

The second step of this task to create a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning is to prepare the data to train our chatbot. I’ll start this step by importing the necessary libraries and packages:

Now I need to vectorize the data using the Tokenization method to create a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning.

Now the next and most important step in the process of building a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning is to train a neural network. Now, I will train and create a neural network to train our chatbot.

I’ve trained the model, but before we go any further in the process of building a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning, let’s save the model so that we can use this neural network in the future as well.

Now I am going to implement a chat function to interact with a real user. When the message from the user will be received, the chatbot will compute the similarity between the sequence of the new text and the training data.


Taking into account the trust scores obtained for each category, it categorizes the user’s message according to an intention with the highest trust score.

This is how we can create a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning. Hope you liked this article on how to create a Chatbot with Python and Machine Learning. Please feel free to ask your valuable questions in the comments section below.
